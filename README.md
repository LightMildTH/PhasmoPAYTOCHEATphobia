# PhasmoPAYTOCHEATphobia
This is a simple mono internal for the game Phasmophobia. I try and use the simplest, most efficient and cleanest methods of doing things that most open source mono internals struggle with. Everything is commented and it should be clear what most things are doing.

# Features
Ghost ESP, Non-host kick every player from a lobby, FOV changer, speedhack, Unlimited money & items, Level changer, A few examples of making the game more scary, Keybind system.
